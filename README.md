# Gen AI Interactive Learning Games

## Problem Statement
Gen AI Interactive Learning Games aims to revolutionize the learning experience by integrating Generative AI with interactive games and educational content. Our project provides a fun, engaging, and effective way of learning through a combination of AI-driven chatbots, games, and courses.

## Approach

- ü§ñ **Custom Chatbot for PDFs:** A chatbot that answers questions based on user-uploaded PDFs using the **Gemini API**.

This approach creates an interactive and engaging gaming environment that promotes learning.
